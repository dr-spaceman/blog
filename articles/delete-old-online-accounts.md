Your old, tired, stale, rotting internet accounts may be a security threat if the account is breached. A great tool for deleting those accounts is [justdelete.me](https://justdelete.me). It's even [open source](https://github.com/justdeleteme/justdelete.me)!

I recently made the switch from LastPass to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) after the former suddenly imposed a paywall (I'm not opposed to paying for such a service, but I felt slighted by the change of policy; Bitwarden made it super easy to import my passwords). In the process of looking for a new password manager I tried out Dashlane, too. Although it has a slick UI, Dashlane at $40/year was not as economical as Bitwarden, $10/year. There are good reasons to choose Bitwarden besides:

- Protects user passwords with 256-bit AES encryption, [virtually unbreakable](https://www.atpinc.com/blog/what-is-aes-256-encryption) with today's computing power
- Open source, active community, extensive scrutiny
- Free option is fine!
- Updating app with new features like [Bitwarden Send](https://bitwarden.com/products/send/)

After deciding on Bitwarden, I revisited Dashlane to delete my account, but to no avail. That feature was hidden somewhere. A quick visit to justdelete.me provided a direct link to the delete process.
