[John Coleman writes](https://hbr.org/2015/07/create-a-conversation-not-a-presentation):

- Active: Presentations should focus on sproblem-solving and debate
- Prepare: Details and information should be given in advance for the audience to understand the important concepts of the presentation beforehand
- "Punchline first": Key conclusions should be presented at the beginning with more in-depth detail given throughout the presentation
